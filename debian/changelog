pgapack (1.0-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replaced fort77 by g77 in the rules file to prevent the
    "Illegal option: -s" error when compiling the fortran examples.

    creating an object file, if the original name contains one or more
    underscores. This is necessary to compile the fortran examples.
